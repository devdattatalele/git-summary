# Welcome to the GitHub Issue Solver

An AI-powered system designed to automate the entire workflow of fixing a software bug, from initial analysis to creating a pull request with a generated code patch.

This project leverages a custom-built knowledge base for each repository, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide context-aware and accurate solutions.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Automation:** Handles the full cycle from issue analysis to PR creation.
- **Repository-Specific Context:** Builds a unique knowledge base for each repository, including its code, issues, and PR history.
- **Intelligent Patch Generation:** Creates code patches based on a deep understanding of the issue and relevant context.
- **Modular & Agentic:** Built with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for modern, agent-based architectures.
